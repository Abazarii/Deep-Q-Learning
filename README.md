# Deep-Q-Learning
Implementing Deep Q learning as Operator selection mechanism for PFSP 
Q-learning folder is the code for Maryam Karimi paper ("Learning to select operators in meta-heuristics: An integration of
Q-learning into the iterated greedy algorithm for the permutation flowshop scheduling problem")
DQL folder is the implementation of the deep q learning algorithm as operator selection mechanism for PFSP. 
Instance set folder contains the taillard dataset. 
In order to run the code, first, you have to run "install_me_first.py". Then, 
For training the DQL:
./DQLearning.py
For training the Q learning:
./main.py
